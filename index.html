        <h2>Hacking</h2>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/2dom/PixelTime/master/images/PixelTime_small.jpg" alt="">
Most hackers are driven by the quest for the perfect hack. A product of elegance, sometimes useful, simple in nature and yet high in impact.
In my humble opinion, further indicators of a good hack are (visual) appeal, low costs and a high degree of repeatability for a large audience.
<br>
<br>
By this definition, I believe that PixelTime is my first project that comes anywhere close to being a perfect hack: it is useful (I also call it the “how to dress the kid’s device”), it is mindboggling easy to make (no soldering or other specialist skills required), looks fantastic, is extremely repeatable (very little manual labour required), costs about 40 EUR and takes about 30 minutes to assemble (+ optional case).


<h2>Display</h2>

Choosing the right display for a project is increasingly difficult these days - there are just so many options! E-Paper, COG LCD, TFT, scanning laser, POV, glow-in-the-dark paper, WS2812B matrix, ferrofluid – you name it. Also, the choice of display defines to some extend the system that drives it. High resolution color varieties require high bus speeds, more memory and processing power. This is less of a problem cost-wise (5 EUR Raspberry PI Zero - check), however, then we usually add the extra complexity of a full blown Linux distribution. This will reduce simplicity and repeatability significantly whilst increasing the involved (set-up) time effort.

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/2dom/PixelTime/master/images/P10_matrix.jpg" alt="">

In the interest of  simplicity I settled on a ESP8266 based NodeMCU microcontroller that comes with pre-soldered pin headers. On the display side of things, I chose a Chinese P10 RGB led matrix module that integrates all the necessary driver electronics into a single piece of kit. It offers 32x16=512 RGB pixels with a 1cm spacing for as little as 17 EUR.  The equivalent with WS2812B leds would cost at least twice as much. Furthermore, the P10 module comes fully assembled in a sturdy plastic module frame with defined screw mounts and offers connectivity via two standard pin-headers. Unfortunately, no reasonable Arduino driver for the ESP8266 existed so far hence I had to write one. The <a href="https://github.com/2dom/P10_matrix">P10_matrix library</a> driver is Arduino GFX compatible so you can use all the standard graphics primitives and fonts. The link also includes the information on how to connect the NodeMCU to the LED matrix. This picture below depicts the library in the early stages of development.

<h2>Assembly</h2>

In order do obtain that vintage computer pixel look, I created a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2668845">16x16 separator grid</a>, then printed it on my 3d printer twice and glued the pieces together to form one big 32x16 grid.
To obtain evenly lit pixels, I used a sheet of A3 copy paper as a diffuser screen. As the front “glass” I got a piece of 3mm black/transparent acrylic. For the back-plate, I screwed another piece of acrylic to the back of the matrix module using the standard screw mounts.

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/2dom/PixelTime/master/images/IMG_0621.jpg" alt="">

The combination of all these parts now leads to something rather neat: all electrical connections are made using standard Dupont style jumper cables. The module frame, the separator grid and the paper are simply sandwiched between the two pieces of acrylic using a few longish M3 screws.

  If you have access to a laser cutter for the acrylics and prefer a clean techie look, you might just stop here. I had an old slatted bed-frame lying around that wanted to be used. So after some woodwork and a few layers of mahogany oil I had a nice box that neatly fits next to my <a href="http://2dom.github.io/the-radio/">radio</a>.

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/2dom/PixelTime/master/images/IMG_0818.jpg" alt="">

  To supply and program PixelTime, I also created a simple <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2665294">NodeMCU panel mount</a>. This mount exposes the micro USB connector as well as both click buttons to the outside of the box. A 2A phone charger and a nice 2m USB cable from ebay completes the assembly.

<h2>Software</h2>

For the software to run you will need to open an account with <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">openweathermap</a> (it's free), edit the Wifi network credentials and update the REST request strings with your openweathermap API key and location. Apart from that, you should just be able to flash the NodeMCU with the code as is. Flashing the NodeMCU requires  <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino">ESP8266 Arduino core</a>.
<br><br>
The display currently shows the temperature/weather of the current and next day. It jumps between minimum temperatures/worst weather and maximum temperatures/best weather in a 5 second interval. The dot on the bottom left indicates what the display is currently showing.  I created some low resolution animated weather icons that are more or less compatible with the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions">openweathermap rest API</a> response. I didn't bother drawing all the night icons (who cares - it's dark).

  Congratulations ... you made it all the way through. PixelTime it is!
